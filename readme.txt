== Description ==

This plugin is essentially an "off switch" for your website.  When activated, the site is mostly blacked out by a banner for the americancensorship.org website.  As the admin bar is left uncovered, all that is needed to reverse this is deactivating the plugin.

A demo is currently available [http://dev.cdmansfield.com/WP/ "here"].

== Installation ==

1. Upload the files to the `/wp-content/plugins/censorme/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get rid of the damn banner?!?!? =

Simply deactivate the plugin.  If it is blocking your ability to login then you may have to use an FTP or SSH application to manually remove the files, or use an in browser webpage editor, such as firebug, to expose the login link or button.
